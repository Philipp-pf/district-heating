# DistrictHeating readme
Model of a district heating system with storage in Dymola.
These models are developed during my masther thesis. 

Models are divided into boilers, storages, consumers and control systems for boilers.
Each Model is tested by an Example. 

For calibration purposes of the storage, measured data of a district heating system is contained in ressources/data. For further information follow that path. 
This folder contains a ReadMe which explains the measurement data.

The thesis is available under ressources/masterthesis
