Model of a district heating system with storage in Dymola.
These models are developed during my masther thesis. 

Models are divided into boilers, storages, consumers and control systems. 
Each Model is tested by an Example. 

For calibration purposes of the storage, measured data of a district heating system is contained in ressources/data.
